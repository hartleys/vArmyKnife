The easiest way to install the most recent version of vArmyKnife is to clone from github:

    git clone https://github.com/hartleys/vArmyKnife

If you have root access you can then copy the two executable files 'vArmyKnife.jar' and 'varmyknife' to /usr/local/bin:

    cd vArmyKnife
    cp vArmyKnife.jar /usr/local/bin
    cp varmyknife /usr/local/bin

OR you can just add the directory to the PATH:

    export PATH="/your/path/to/vArmyKnife:${PATH}"

If don't want to have to execute the above line every time, you can add it to your .bashrc and/or .profile scripts.
