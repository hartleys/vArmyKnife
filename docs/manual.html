<h1>INTRODUCTION:</h1>

<p>vArmyKnife is...</p>

<h1>INSTALLATION AND SETUP:</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/hartleys/vArmyKnife/releases">You can download the most recent stable version of vArmyKnife here</a>,
or you can use the <a href="https://github.com/hartleys/vArmyKnife/tarball/master">most recent experimental build here</a>.</p>

<p>Simply download the vArmyKnife.tar.gz file and extract it to your preferred location.</p>

<pre><code>tar xvzf varmyknife.tar.gz /my/install/directory/
</code></pre>

<p>If you are running either Linux or OSX, you can install the software onto your PATH using the command:</p>

<pre><code>export PATH=/my/install/directory/:$PATH
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can test vArmyKnife and see the basic syntax using either of the commands:</p>

<pre><code>varmyknife help
   or
java -jar /my/install/directory/vArmyKnife.jar help
</code></pre>

<h1>RECOMMENDED ENVIRONMENT AND JAVA OPTIONS:</h1>

<p>I have found that the following environment variables seem to improve stability and performance
when using vArmyKnife on a cluster or HPC-like environment.</p>

<pre><code>export _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xms1g -XX:ParallelGCThreads=1 -Xss512m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled"
export MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=1
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you're usually going to want to set the maximum memory. How much memory is required
will depend on the type of job. The more large annotation files that need to be loaded,
the more memory will be required. Note however that if you restrict to only one chromosome,
most of the annotation files will only be loaded for that chromosome, greatly reducing the
memory footprint.</p>

<p>You can set the memory usage by adding "-Xmx4g" just after "varmyknife" when you invoke vArmyKnife,
changing "4g" to however many gigabytes you think you will need. Note that if java starts to
run low on memory it will slow down considerably as it tries to conserve. It's usually best
to allocate some extra memory as needed. So for example, to set the max memory to 4 gigabytes:</p>

<pre><code>varmyknife -Xmx4g walkVcf inputVcf.vcf.gz outputVcf.vcf.gz
</code></pre>
