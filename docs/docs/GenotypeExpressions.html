<pre><code>Variant expressions are logical expressions that are performed 
    at the variant level. They are used by several parts of 
    vArmyKnife, usually when filtering or differentiating 
    variants based on it's properties/stats. For any given 
    variant, a variant expression will return either TRUEor 
    FALSE. Variant expressions are parsed as a series of 
    logical functionsconnected with AND, OR, NOT, and 
    parentheses. All expressions MUSTbe separated with 
    whitespace, though it does not matter how muchwhitespace or 
    what kind. Alternatively, expressions can be readdirectly 
    from file by setting the expression 
    toEXPRESSIONFILE:filepath.
Variant Expression functions are all of the 
    formatFILTERNAME:PARAM1:PARAM2:etc. Some filters have no 
    parameters; other filters can accept a variable number of 
    parameters. Allexpression functions return TRUE or FALSE. 
    Filters can be inverted using theNOT operator before the 
    filter (with whitespace in between).
