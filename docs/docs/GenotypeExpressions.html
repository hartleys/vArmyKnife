<pre><code>Filtering expressions are parsed as a series of logical filters 
    connected with AND, OR, NOT, and parentheses. All 
    expressions must be separated with whitespace, though it 
    does not matter how much whitespace or what kind. 
    Alternatively, expressions can be read directly from file 
    by setting the expression to EXPRESSIONFILE:filepath.
Logical filters are all of the format 
    FILTERNAME:PARAM1:PARAM2:etc. Some filters have no 
    parameters, other filters can accept a variable number of 
    parameters. All filters return TRUE or FALSE. Filters can 
    be inverted using the NOT operator before the filter (with 
    whitespace in between). Unless indicated otherwise, 
    elements are dropped when the full expression returns FALSE.
