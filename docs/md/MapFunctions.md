## VARIANT OPERATIONS

    
    Variant Operations or Variant Map Functions are a set of 
        sub-utilities that perform operations on a variant set one 
        variant at a time. When more than one function is specified 
        in a run, these functions are performed in the order that 
        they appear in the command line, after all other operations 
        have been carried out (excluding output ops).
    Basic Syntax:
        --FCN functionName|ID|param1=p1|param2=p2|...

## Available Functions:

        SNPeff.(String, default=ANN)

        biotypes that you want to keep. All other biotypes will be 
        ignored.(String)

        you want to keep. All other EFFECT values will be 
        ignored.(String)

        ignored.(String)
    geneListName: (String)
    geneList: (String)
    severityList: Must be a list of severity levels, listed as some 
        combination of effectseverity types delimited with slashes. 
        Legal types are: HIGH, MODERATE, LOW, and MODIFIER, which 
        are standard SnpEFF effect types, and also: NS (HIGH and 
        MODERATE), NonNS (LOW and MODIFIER), and ANY (any 
        type).(String, default=HIGH/MODERATE/LOW)
    extractFields: This is a complex multi-part field that allows 
        flexible extraction of information from SnpEff ANN tags. 
        This field must be in the colon-delimited format 
        tagInfix:ANN_idx:description:severityList[:noCollapse]. 
        severityList must be in the same format as the severityList 
        parameter above, but can override the default if desired. 
        ANN_idx must be a slash-delimited list of field indices 
        counting from zero in the ANN tag. The standard ANN field 
        indices are: 0:allele,1:effect,2:impact,3:geneName,4:geneID-
        ,5:txType,6:txID,7:txBiotype,8:rank,9:HGVS.c,10:HGVS.p,11:c-

        ure,15:warnings,16:errors If multiple fields are selected 
        then the output fields will have the format 
        first:second:third:etc. For example, to create two new 
        fields containing a list of all genes for which the current 
        variant has HIGH and MODERATE impact respectively, use the 
        format: myNewField:4:my description:HIGH/MODERATE. This

        myNewField_MODERATE. Note that if this function as a whole
